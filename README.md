## Executing the tests
To run the sample project, you can either just run the `CucumberTestSuite` test runner class, or run either `mvn verify` or `gradle test` from the command line.

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Ddriver=firefox
```
Or
```json
$ gradle clean test -Pdriver=firefox
```

The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory.

 
### Webdriver configuration
The WebDriver configuration is managed entirely from this file, as illustrated below:
```java
webdriver {
    driver = chrome
}
headless.mode = true

chrome.switches="""--start-maximized;--test-type;--no-sandbox;--ignore-certificate-errors;
                   --disable-popup-blocking;--disable-default-apps;--disable-extensions-file-access-check;
                   --incognito;--disable-infobars,--disable-gpu"""

```

Serenity uses WebDriverManager to download the WebDriver binaries automatically before the tests are executed.

### Environment-specific configurations
We can also configure environment-specific properties and options, so that the tests can be run in different environments. Here, we configure three environments, __dev__, _staging_ and _prod_, with different starting URLs for each:
```json
environments {
  default {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com"
  }
  dev {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/dev"
  }
  staging {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/staging"
  }
  prod {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/prod"
  }
}
```

You use the `environment` system property to determine which environment to run against. For example to run the tests in the staging environment, you could run:
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Denvironment=staging
```
